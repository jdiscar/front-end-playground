JDiscar's Front End Playground
====

I made this repository to house front end code that is more experimental, just for fun, or is a proof of concept. By just for fun, I mean projects that are functional, but not necessarily production ready and not planned to ever be touched again. If something ends up being useful, reusable, or production-grade, I'll move it out from here into its own repository.

So, it's as the name says: JDiscar's Front End Playground.
